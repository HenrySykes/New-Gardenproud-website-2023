            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p>Gardenproud is an organisation with a vision. 

                We love architecture and we adore plants.
                
                We have an integrated approach to garden design, landscaping and garden maintenance.
                
                Based in Tunbridge Wells, the company was established by Tim Sykes in 2007. This has now grown and through its own teams and partners, Gardenproud now designs, manages and builds landscaping solutions throughout Kent, East Sussex and Hertfordshire.  
                
                Our design and construction projects range from £5,000 - £250,000. 
                
                Our gardeners care for courtyards, to large country estates.
                
                Whatever the size of your garden, our approach will embody the same insight and attention to detail that will help make you proud and we hope enjoy your outdoor space for many years to come.
            </p>
